======== WarPi.G Zero2W - Python Wardriver for Pi Zero2w ======== 

Dual-OLED live telemetry + Wi-Fi/Bluetooth scanning system for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
Designed for compact wardriving rigs.

- Designed and tested on Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- Optimized for low power, portable wardriving use
- Intended for educational and lawful wireless surveying only - Author IS NOT liable for end users actions.
- Supports 2x SSD1306 (128×64) I²C OLED displays, pulls device/system stats, and continuously updates live scan data in real time.
- Future display support additions planned - Can be manually configured for your display.

✨ **WarPi.G Features**

📡 **WiFi Wardriving**
- Wi-Fi Uses _iwlist_ for maximum compatibility
- Shows current visible SSIDs
- Counts current visible devices
- Stores unique SSIDs for "Total Seen This Boot"

📶 **Bluetooth**
- Uses _bluetoothctl_ scan on/off
- Shows current visible Device Names
- Counts current visible devices
- Stores unique MACs "Total Seen This Boot"

📺 **Native Dual OLED Output - 40pin GPIO SLC**

✔ Multithreaded

Separate Wi-Fi and Bluetooth worker threads keep counts live and responsive.

✔ Clean Icons

Minimal WiFi + BT glyphs for clarity.

📦 **Hardware Requirements**

Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W

Two SSD1306 OLED displays

Working Wi-Fi + Bluetooth (built-in)

Software

**Install dependencies:**

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-smbus python3-pil i2c-tools
pip3 install luma.oled psutil


**Enable I2C:**

sudo raspi-config

🔧 How It Works
Thread & Data Flow
Component	Description
wifi_scanner()	Performs repeated iwlist wlan0 scan operations. Updates count + unique total.
bt_scanner()	Runs bluetoothctl scan on/off. Tracks visible and total MACs.
get_cpu_temp()	Converts Pi temp to Fahrenheit.
get_usb_voltage()	Reads Pi 5V rail via vcgencmd measure_volts.
canvas(oled)	Draws each frame on both displays.
threading.Lock()	Prevents races between the two scan threads.


▶ Setup AutoRun Automatically (systemd)

Create a service:

/etc/systemd/system/oled.service

[Unit]
Description=WarScanner OLED Display Service
After=network.target bluetooth.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/YOURUSER/oled.py
Restart=always
User=pi

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Enable and start:

sudo systemctl enable oled.service
sudo systemctl start oled.service


Restart live without reboot:

sudo systemctl restart oled.service

🧪 Known Limitations

Wi-Fi scan speed depends on local RF noise.

Bluetooth scanning may miss some devices using privacy MAC rotation.

OLEDs can burn in if static text is displayed for long periods.

🚀 Planned for V2

Auto-save CSV of all seen Wi-Fi + BT devices

Hotkey-triggered mode switching

Optional e-ink version (ultra-low-power)
